Welcome to MunchkinJS 1.0!

Here are the specifics to this online version of Munchkin:

Your cards will appear at the bottom of the screen, with the option to switch between your
field cards and hand cards. Your fellow players' field cards and game information (name,
level, strength, and gender) appear above your cards in the middle of the screen. You can
toggle between their fields by clicking on their player information. Above that area
is the Game Field, where the Door and Treasure decks are available. All cards that concern
everyone including kicked cards, monsters in combat, and shared treasures belong here.
At the tippity top of your screen, you will see a banner that contains (from left to right),
the Turn Player (player whose turn it is), the monster strength with buttons that increase or
decrease its strength, your information (name, gender, strength, and level) with buttons to
increase or decrease your strength/level, and finally a random value field to hold pseudo
dice rolls.

On the left sidebar, you will find a chat that allows you to send messages to all players
and that lets you know when a player connects or disconnects with a satisfying DING! Below
that is the game History, where game actions are logged for everyone to keep record of what's
going on while we wait for the more automated MunchkinJS 2.0!

Meanwhile, once selected by left clicking on card images, actions can be performed on the cards.
These actions can be found on the left under "Game Options" and "Misc Options". For example,
if you would like to move any visible card to some location, you may select any such cards,
then mouse over "Move Cards" under "Misc Options" and select any location from the menu
including: your hand, your field, the game field, the doors deck, the treasures deck, and
any player's hand.

All cards in your field are considered "equipped." If you wish to "unequip" cards, you may
do so by right clicking them (bringing up a red border).

In order to draw, you can either select the "Draw" menu under "Game Options" to draw one card
normally or by choice (the deck will appear and you may move cards using the "Move Cards" option
under "Misc Options." If you wish to draw normally more quickly, you may left click the door or
treasure card at the top of the game field to draw one card from the respective deck. If you wish
to draw face up, right click the deck.

Typical turn: Player1 level 3, strength 3, male
Player1 takes a gander at their hand and decides to add the Dwarf race card, Rat on a Stick
item (+1 Bonus), and Broad Sword item (+3 Bonus) to his field by left clicking the cards, mousing
over "Move Cards" under "Misc Options," then selecting field. However, since Broad Sword is only
usable by females, he must unequip it by going to his field and right clicking Broad Sword. After
he finishes setting up and increases his strength by 1 due to Rat on a Stick, he selects "Kick"
under "Game Options" and a card pops up in the top field. It's a curse! Bleh, he reads the curse
and sees it's just Lost the Footgear You Are Wearing, so he is safe. He selects the card, then clicks
"Discard" on the left under "Game Options." Now, Player1 can either Loot the Room or Look for Trouble.
Feeling pretty good about that loser curse card, he decides to Look for Trouble, and whips out the
Lame Goblin card, a measley level 1 monster. He changes monster strength at the top by 1, then declares
in chat that he wants to beat it! However, Player2 has other things in mind, and curses Player1 by
selecting Income Tax curse card, mousing over "Curse" under "Game Options" and choosing Player1. The card
goes to his field, but since it affects everyone, Player1 decides to put it in the Game Field by using
"Move Cards" again. Unfortunately, he loses a level and his bonus thanks to that, so his strength and level
are two. Now, Player1 has no choice but to run away from the Lame Goblin in shame since he can no longer
ask for help. Player2 cackles on his side of the screen as he send the message: "LOL rekt." So, Player1
clicks "Get Roll" on the left and a number appears next to Random Val on the tippity top of the screen,
to the right. It's a 4, the dice roll failed and Player1 loses another level thanks to the Lame Goblin's
bad stuff, shooting all the way back to level 1 where he started. Player1 selects the monster and any
other cards on the game field, and selects "Discard" under "Game Options." He checks if he has more
cards than he is supposed to, but remembers he is level 1, so there was no one to charity to anyhow.
Then, (crying all the while) he clicks "End Turn" under "Game Options," Turn Player changes to Player2,
and his turn commences. Player1 finds solace in the fact that at least no one can see him through the
computer screen as he types "Haha, good one Player2," while whispering to himself, "Conceal, don't feel..."

Unexplained Options:

Toggle Hand - Show your hand to the other players (perhaps you died).
